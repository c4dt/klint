This is the artifact for the paper "Automated Verification of Network Function Binaries" presented at NSDI'22.


- `benchmarking` is the benchmarking scripts (copied from TinyNF with some "improvements" that should be double-checked)
- `experiments` are the scripts for the paper eval
- `os` is the NFOS
- `nf` are NFs
- `tool` is the verification tool
- `Makefile.base` is the common Makefile between OS and NFs
- `Makefile.benchmarking` is the Makefile to benchmark NFs

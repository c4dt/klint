    # and rewrites code to map between the two. See `xdp_convert_ctx_access` in net/core/filter.c in Linux.
    # The xdp_md members are mapped with:
    # - data: data
    # - data_end: data_end
    # - data_meta: data_meta
    # - ingress_ifindex: rxq->dev->ifindex
    # - rx_queue_index: rxq->queue_index
    # - egress_ifindex: txq->dev->ifindex (in newer kernels only)
    # The 'fun' part is that these structures are kernel internals, thus they can and do change across releases...
    # so the best we can do is hardcode the offsets for specific releases.

    # For now let's only support {data, data_end, ingress_ifindex}.
    # This means we must have 'rxq' which must have a 'dev' which must have an 'ifindex'

    # If you're reading this because you got the exception below, what you need to do is:
    # - See what 'import platform; print(platform.release(), platform.architecture()[0])' returns on your system, and add an 'elif' case below
    # - Add information about the offsets in that case, which you can get either by compiling a BPF program that uses ifindex and dumping it,
    #   or by manually looking at Linux's 'include/net/xdp.h' and 'include/linux/netdevice.h', but don't forget to include padding...
    #   Note that offsets are in bytes!
    # - Once it works, send a pull request ;-)
    # NOTE: If these don't change across minor releases, it may be worth doing a substring check on the major version instead... do they change?
